# Movie Trailer Website

This project consists of a movie trailer list website that is generated by a python script. A hosted version of a generated website can be viewed [here](https://riusuky.github.io/udacity-full-stack/1.Movie_Trailer_Website/index.html).

## Getting Started

Before trying to run the project, make sure you have [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.

The website can be generated and opened by running the `entertainment_center.py` located in the `scripts` folder. You can run it either using the IDLE that comes with the Python installation, or, if you have your environment variables set up, by simply running `python entertainment_center.py` on a console opened at the `scripts` folder.

Once you run the script, the generated website will be located at the projects root named `index.html`.

## APIs Used

This project uses the [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org) API to retrieve the current popular movies that are listed in the generated website.
